## Project Idea
In this project, we plan to design a master-chip that can sync with all the (IoT) hardware devices in the environment to which it is connected. User can set the modes of all the connected hardware such as home appliances via the Windows phone application. The settings are then stored on cloud, now irrespective of where the user goes (hotel, home, office etc.) the proposed model will allow his/her personalised settings to be loaded onto all the available hardware present in his/her current environment, connected and controlled by a local master-chip. Also the user can remotely control devices at his home and schedule switching On/Off of devices. For security concerns, we plan to provide access to the profile only when an user confirms his identity (for e.g. normal passwords or Aadhaar apiâ€™s for biometric based secure verification).
